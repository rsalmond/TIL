# Cool Things

## January 2025

A [stylish, programmable, and open source](https://qrframe.kylezhe.ng/) QR code generator.

An [app](https://github.com/DrewThomasson/ebook2audiobook) to turn an ebook into an audiobook.

An [open source project](https://github.com/nisargjhaveri/WirelessAndroidAutoDongle) that turns a raspberry pi into a wireless android auto adapter.

A [DSL from StackExchange](https://github.com/StackExchange/dnscontrol) for generating DNS configurations. Not sure why one would use this over something like terraform or external-dns but it does seem cool.

A [geofencing event service](https://tile38.com/). Get notified by mqtt, sqs, NATS, etc. when things enter / exit a geofence.:w
