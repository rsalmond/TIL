# Cool Things

## January 2025

[Streamlink](https://streamlink.github.io/) is a a CLI for playing web videos in VLC.

Cyberpunk IRL - [restofworld.org](https://restofworld.org) is a tech publication that covers everything outside of Western countries. Their [2025 photo contest winners](https://restofworld.org/2025/tech-photography-contest-winners/) has big "the street finds its own uses for things" energy.

The person who created the Caddy webserver seems to have created an all purpose self hosted [personal timeline tool](https://github.com/timelinize/timelinize). You export your data from any number of services (google location history, icloud, strava) and overlay it all onto a contiguous timeline.

Not sure I completely understand the use case, devops involves lots of Go, Python, and Bash already, but [the risor scripting language](https://risor.io/) definitely rings the "this seems useful" bell in the back of my head. Somebody made a [tool](https://github.com/risor-io/risor/discussions/259) that allows you to package a risor script as an executable.

A [diagramming tool](https://schem.io/) purpose built for interactive technical systems. It's hard to explain but if you're an SRE you will probably find this exciting. [This video](https://youtu.be/idUW5sYV2oE?si=YfoB1JeRMB71l0oF) helps.

A [stylish, programmable, and open source](https://qrframe.kylezhe.ng/) QR code generator.

An [app](https://github.com/DrewThomasson/ebook2audiobook) to turn an ebook into an audiobook.

An [open source project](https://github.com/nisargjhaveri/WirelessAndroidAutoDongle) that turns a raspberry pi into a wireless android auto adapter.

A [DSL from StackExchange](https://github.com/StackExchange/dnscontrol) for generating DNS configurations. Not sure why one would use this over something like terraform or external-dns but it does seem cool.

A [geofencing event service](https://tile38.com/). Get notified by mqtt, sqs, NATS, etc. when things enter / exit a geofence.:w
