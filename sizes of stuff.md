# tl;dr

Shorter Wavelength == Higher Frequency

# Planck Length

About 1.616255 × 10<sup>-35</sup> meters or about 10<sup>−20</sup> times the size of a proton

Distance that light travels in one Planck time, or put another way the speed of light is one Planck length per Planck time.

# Attometer

10<sup>-18</sup> meters.

## Proton

The CODATA recommended value: 8.4075(64) × 10<sup>−16</sup> meters

# Femtometer

From the Danish "femten" for "fifteen".

10<sup>-15</sup> meters.

## Hydrogen Nucleus

1.7 femtometers

1.7 x 10<sup>-15</sup>

## Uranium Nucleus

11.7 femtometers

11.7 x 10<sup>-15</sup>

# Picometer

One trillionth of a meter, or 1000 femtometers.

10<sup>-12</sup> meters.

# Angstrom

One ten-billionth of a meter, 0.1 nanometers, 100 picometers.

10<sup>-10</sup> meters.

# Nanometer

One billionth of a meter, 1000 picometers.

10<sup>-9</sup> meters.

# Micrometer (AKA "micron")

One millionth of a meter, one thousandth of a millimeter.

10<sup>-6</sup> meters.

# Millimeter

One thousandth of a meter.

10<sup>-3 meters.

# Meter

About one yard, or three feet.

# Kilometer

A thousand meters.

# Astronomical Unit

Average distance between Earth and Sol.

1.495978707 ×10<sup>11 meters.

149,597,870,700 meters.

~150 million km

# Light year
9.46 trillion km, or 63,240 AUs

# Parsec

"Parallax arcsecond"

The distance at which a remote object's parallax angle is one arcsecond, when viewed from two points separated by one astronomical unit.

IE. look at it today then wait six months for the Earth to move to the other side of the Sun and view it again, if the apparent parallax motion of the near object against the backdrop of distant objects == 1 arcecond, then the near object is one parsec away.

3.26 light years, or 206,265 AUs
