# In Language

Broken out into [two broad sections](https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/meaning/#TwoKindTheoMean) - semantics and metasymantics. Crudely: "what do these words mean to these people?" vs "what is it about these people that makes these words meaningful to them?".

## [Semantics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Semantics)

Study of meaning in languages, examines what linguistic meaning is and how it arises.
Aims to describe *how meaning works* without prescribing any specific meaning which should be ascribed to particular expressions.
Has an **internal** and **external** side; internal side is interested in the connection between words and the mental phenomena
they invoke. External side is interested in how words refer to objects in the world and under what conditions a sentence is true.

 * [Lexical Semantics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lexical_semantics) - individual word meaning
 * Phrasal Semantics - meaning of sentences, how new meanings can be created by arranging words
 * [Formal Semantics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Formal_semantics_(natural_language)) - combines logic and math to examine relationship between language and meaning
 * [Cognitive Semantics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cognitive_semantics) - examines meaning from a psychelogical perspectiv

## [Semiotics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Semiotics#Syntactics)

Study of signs and how they are used to create and convey meaning. Examines the nature of signs, their organization into sign systems,
and the ways they are interpreted and used. Signs are entities that stand for something else, and can take many forms like sounds,
images, written marks, or gestures.
