### Wired For Negatives

A false negative is more deadly than a false positive, therefore evolution favours false positives.

Lisa Feldman Barrett [on sensory systems and prediction errors](https://how-emotions-are-made.com/notes/Structure_of_the_cortex).

> When viewed in terms of anatomical structure, the implication is that the neurons within the interoceptive network will be slower to change their firing in response to the modifications that arise from incoming sensory input, whereas other sensory networks, such as the visual or auditory networks, will be more quickly influenced by prediction error.

Therefore: sensory prediction errors are more likely to be false positives
AND: after a false positive, visual and auditory senses will correct quickly, while interoception will be slow to correct
Therefore: little things will agitate you long after you should have let them go.
