## Oversimplified Terminology

Note: assumes we're talking human heads.

* Dorsal / Superior -> top
* Ventral / Inferior -> bottom
* Anterior / Rostral -> front (rostral == towards the nose)
* Posterior / Caudal -> back (caudal == towards the tail)
* Medial -> middle (interior)
* Lateral -> sides

### Phrases / Terms

nucleus / nucleus group: localized cluster of neuronal cell bodies in the CNS, often within a defined region. generally share similar structure, function, and connectivity. (Note the basal ganglia is in the CNS and shoulda been called the basal nucleus but the name stuck for historic reasons).

ganglia: like a nucleus but in the PNS

neural circuit: network of interconnected neurons, can span multiple brain regions, often involve multiple nucleus groups.

### Broadly Speaking

#### Cerebrum: "brain"

Comprised of:

* cerebral cortex (surface of the cerebrum)
* subcortical structures (stuff under the surface)

Divided into:

* two hemispheres left/right
* four lobes:
  * frontal
  * parietal (top & back)
  * temporal (lower sides & back)
  * occipital (back)

#### Cerebellum: "little brain"

### Systems

Limbic:
* aka "paleomammalian cortex"
* located on both sides of the thalamus, under the medial temporal lobe.

### Areas

ACC:  anterior cingulate cortex
 * sACC: subcallosal ACC

MFC: medial frontal contex
 * rMFC: rostral

PFC: prefrontal cortex
 * mPFC: medial PFC
 * vmPFC: ventral medial
 * rmPFC: rostromedial

PCC: posterior cingulate cortex

Inferior Parietal Lobule

Thalamus:
 * VPL: ventral posterolatoral nucleus
 * VPM: ventral posteromedial nucleus
 * ventral intermediate nucleus

### Networks

Salience Network
- AKA "midcingulo-insular network" (M-CIN)
- AKA "ventral attention network"
- Mediates between DMN and Central Executive Network
  - "stop daydreaming and look around!"
- composed of
  - anterior insula
  - dorsal anterior cingulate cortex (dACC)

Central Executive Network CEN
- AKA "frontoparietal network" FPN
- AKA "lateral frontoparietal network" L-FPN
- composed of
  - dorsolateral prefrontal cortex dPFC
    - particularly the middle frontal gyrus
  - anterior inferior parietal lobule
  - cingulate gyrus

Default Mode Network
- AKA "medial frontoparietal network"
- AKA "default state network"
- loosely "imagination network"
- loosely "self system"
- composed of
  - dorsal medial prefrontal cortex (dMPFC)
  - posterior cingulate cortex (PCC)
  - precuneus
  - angular gyrus
