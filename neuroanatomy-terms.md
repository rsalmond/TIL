## Oversimplified Terminology

Note: assumes we're talking human heads.

* Dorsal / Superior -> top
* Ventral / Inferior -> bottom
* Anterior / Rostral -> front (rostral == towards the nose)
* Posterior / Caudal -> back (caudal == towards the tail)
* Medial -> middle (interior)
* Lateral -> sides

### Phrases / Terms

nucleus / nucleus group: localized cluster of neuronal cell bodies in the CNS, often within a defined region. generally share similar structure, function, and connectivity. (Note the basal ganglia is in the CNS and shoulda been called the basal nucleus but the name stuck for historic reasons).

ganglia: like a nucleus but in the PNS

neural circuit: network of interconnected neurons, can span multiple brain regions, often involve multiple nucleus groups.

### Broadly Speaking

#### Cerebrum: "brain"

Comprised of:

* cerebral cortex (surface of the cerebrum)
* subcortical structures (stuff under the surface)



#### Cerebellum: "little brain"

### Systems

Limbic:
* aka "paleomammalian cortex"
* located on both sides of the thalamus, under the medial temporal lobe.
* where the subcortical structures meet the cortex
* influences endocrine and autonomic function
* Sapolsky in "Behave" - "... the deeply held desire of every limbic structure (is) to influence the hypothalamus ..."
* Hypothalamus:
  * Sapolsky in "Behave" - "... it's the means by which the limbic system influences autonomic function ..."
* Amygdala:
  * Sapolsky in "Behave" - "the most important theme is the amygdala's dual role in aggression and facets of fear and anxiety." 
  * bilateral structure (one in each hemisphere)
  * surrounded by basolateral amygdala (BLA)
    * sensory systems send projections here 
    * this is where learned fear happens
* Hippocampus:
  * memory, spatial navigation
  * Sapolsky "Behave" - "the hippocampus decides whether a factoid is worth filing away, depending on whether the amygdala has gotten worked up over it."

Cortex:
* From latin `cortic` meaning "tree bark".
* Sapolsky in "Behave" - "most sensory information flows here to be decoded"
* NOT separate from limbic system: lots of axonal projections between the two
  * Sapolsky in "Behave" - "In different circumstances the frontal cortex and limbic system stimulate or inhibit each other ... It really is an honourary member of the limbic system."

* two hemispheres left/right

* four lobes separated by fissures or "sulci" / "sulcus"
  * frontal lobe
    * separated from parietal by central sulcus
    * separated from temporal by sylvian sulcus
    * further divided into
      * lateral
      * polar
      * medial
      * orbital (aka basal / medial)
  * parietal lobe (top & back)
    * separated from occipital by occipital sulcus
  * temporal lobe (lower sides & back)
    * separated from occipital by exoccipital sulcus
  * occipital lobe (back)



frontal cortex - thin outer multifurrowed surface of the frontal lobe
* motor cortex - top & sides, back towards parietal lobe
* prefrontal cortex (PFC) - very front of the frontal cortex - evolutionarily newest part of the frontal cortex
 * mPFC: medial PFC
 * vmPFC: ventral medial
 * rmPFC: rostromedial
 * Insular Cortex - smaller cortex inside the lateral sulcus
   * activates with amygdala when disgusted

ACC: anterior cingulate cortex (central to empathy)
 * sACC: subcallosal ACC

MFC: medial frontal contex
 * rMFC: rostral

PCC: posterior cingulate cortex

Inferior Parietal Lobule

Thalamus:
 * VPL: ventral posterolatoral nucleus
 * VPM: ventral posteromedial nucleus
 * ventral intermediate nucleus

### Networks

Salience Network
- AKA "midcingulo-insular network" (M-CIN)
- AKA "ventral attention network"
- Mediates between DMN and Central Executive Network
  - "stop daydreaming and look around!"
- composed of
  - anterior insula
  - dorsal anterior cingulate cortex (dACC)

Central Executive Network CEN
- AKA "frontoparietal network" FPN
- AKA "lateral frontoparietal network" L-FPN
- composed of
  - dorsolateral prefrontal cortex dPFC
    - particularly the middle frontal gyrus
  - anterior inferior parietal lobule
  - cingulate gyrus

Default Mode Network
- AKA "medial frontoparietal network"
- AKA "default state network"
- loosely "imagination network"
- loosely "self system"
- composed of
  - dorsal medial prefrontal cortex (dMPFC)
  - posterior cingulate cortex (PCC)
  - precuneus
  - angular gyrus
