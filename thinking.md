### Reasoning

Deduction: Drawing a conclusion based on a broadly generalized premise. Operates on the principle of logical necessity, conclusion follow necessarily from premises. Allows for **definitive** and conclusive outcomes if the premises are true.

Induction: Drawing a conclusion based on a single specific example. Aims to make general claims based on limited evidence. Do not guarantee certainty, but provide support for the conclusion.

Abduction: Draws a conclusion which attempts a plausible explanation for a given observation. Not logically watertight, may seem to be the best explanation while other hypothesis are still possible.
