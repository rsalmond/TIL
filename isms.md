# Dualism (AKA mind-body dualism)
The mental and the physical are fundamentally distinct.

## Substance dualism (AKA Cartesian dualism)
Asserts that mind and matter are fundamentally distinct.

## Property dualism

Asserts that rather than being fundamentally distinct from matter, mind is a property of matter akin to how mass length are properties of matter.

# Monism

Attributes a singular nature or oneness to something.

## Substance Monism

Only one type of substance exists.

### Physicalism

Everything that exists relies on physical elements for its existence. Related to, and evolved from materialism, but includes more than just matter. Also includes the other broad concerns of physics; energy, physical laws, space, time, information, forces, etc.

### Materialism

Everything including mental states and consciousness are results of material interactions.

Empiricism: the view that knowledge can only be gained, if at all, by experience.

Epiphenominalism: consciousneses is a byproduct / side effect, it has no causal influence.
 * considered to be a form of property dualism.

Fideism: "faith-ism", the view that faith is superior to reason at identifying truth, particularly religious truth.

Logical Positivism: born of empiricism, a movement which aims to make philosophy as authoritative as physical sciences. Rejects many claims about ethics, theology, metaphysics as "cognitively meaningless" as they cannot be verified by empirical observation.

Nominalism: the view that universals and abstract objects (like numbers) do not actually exist other than being merely names or labels.

---


Positivism: the view that all genuine knowledge is true by definition (positive), that is; facts derived by reason, logic, and sensory experience. Intuition, introspection, and faith are considered meaningless.

Relativism: (at least some) things only have the properties they have in the context of the framework used to assess them (eg. beauty is in the eye of the beholder).

## Reductionism

The idea that some phenomena can be described as some interactino of simpler phenomena.

Ontological reductionism: reality consists of some number of small parts.

Methodological reductionism: an explanation of phenomena comprised of ever smaller entities.

Theory reductionsim: the idea that a theory does not replace another theory, but reduces it to simpler terms.
