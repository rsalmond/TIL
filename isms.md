Empiricism: the view that knowledge can only be gained, if at all, by experience.

Fideism: "faith-ism", the view that faith is superior to reason at identifying truth, particularly religious truth.

Nominalism: the view that universals and abstract objects (like number) do not actually exist other than being merely names or labels.

Relativism: (at least some) things only have the properties they have in the context of the framework used to assess them (eg. beauty is in the eye of the beholder).
