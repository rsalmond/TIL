# Teleology: things are defined by their purpose
# Ontology: the study of being, what is real
# Epistemology: the study of knowledge, what is knowable


### Semiotics: study of symbols and the communication of meaning.

# Dualism (AKA mind-body dualism)
The mental and the physical are fundamentally distinct.

## Substance dualism (AKA Cartesian dualism)
Asserts that mind and matter are fundamentally distinct.

## Property dualism

Asserts that rather than being fundamentally distinct from matter, mind is a property of matter akin to how mass length are properties of matter.

---

# Monism

Attributes a singular nature or oneness to something.

## Substance Monism

Only one type of substance exists.

### Physicalism

Everything that exists relies on physical elements for its existence. Related to, and evolved from materialism, but includes more than just matter. Also includes the other broad concerns of physics; energy, physical laws, space, time, information, forces, etc.

### Materialism

Everything including mental states and consciousness are results of material interactions. (An older term, generally supplanted by "physicalism").

Empiricism: the view that knowledge can only be gained, if at all, by experience.

Epiphenominalism: consciousneses is a byproduct / side effect, it has no causal influence.
 * considered to be a form of property dualism.

Fideism: "faith-ism", the view that faith is superior to reason at identifying truth, particularly religious truth.

Logical Positivism: born of empiricism, a movement which aims to make philosophy as authoritative as physical sciences. Rejects many claims about ethics, theology, metaphysics as "cognitively meaningless" as they cannot be verified by empirical observation.

Nominalism: the view that universals and abstract objects (like numbers) do not actually exist other than being merely names or labels.

---

Positivism: the view that all genuine knowledge is true by definition (positive), that is; facts derived by reason, logic, and sensory experience. Intuition, introspection, and faith are considered meaningless.

Relativism: (at least some) things only have the properties they have in the context of the framework used to assess them (eg. beauty is in the eye of the beholder).

---

## Reductionism

The idea that some phenomena can be described as some interactino of simpler phenomena.

Ontological reductionism: reality consists of some number of small parts.

Methodological reductionism: an explanation of phenomena comprised of ever smaller entities.

Theory reductionsim: the idea that a theory does not replace another theory, but reduces it to simpler terms.

---

Holism: the idea that parts of a system cannot be studied separately from the entire system

---

Essentialism: the view that all things have properties which are necessary to their identity (part of their essence). Essentialism is based on sameness (contrast with "population thinking" which is based on variance).  Broadly, essentialism is any philosophy which acknowladges the primacy of essence.

---

Affective realism: "the phenomenon that you experience what you believe" (LFB - "How Emotions Are Made") "(the) brain continually predicts the meaning of sensations (e.g., identifying a sound as a siren, or a visual array as a face) in part by representing the current state of the body and the immediate physiological impact that similar sensory events have entailed in the past." ([article](doi.org/10.1007/s42761-022-00114-9))


---

Pragmatism: views language and thought as tools for prediction, problem solving, and action, rather than describing, representing, or mirroring reality. Pragmatists contend that most philosophical topics—such as the nature of knowledge, language, concepts, meaning, belief, and science—are best viewed in terms of their practical uses and successes.

> Kinda sounds like the Behaviourism of meaning.
