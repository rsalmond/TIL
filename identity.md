# Identity

From latin "identitas" meaning "sameness", identity is the relation each thing bears **only** to itself.

Social science considers [identity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Identity_(social_science)) to be "the set of qualities, beliefs, personality traits, appearance, or expressions that characterize a person or a group."

Sociology emphasizes [collective identity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Collective_identity) or group identity which is a shared sense of belonging to a group.

[Philosophy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Identity_(philosophy)) differentiates between numerical identity and qualitative identity. In numeric identity all features and properties are identical, eg. your mother and your siblings mother are numerically identical. In qualitative identity many, but not all, features are identical, eg. two people who drive a car of the same make, model, year, and colour are driving cars which are qualitatively identical. Note that qualitative identity can be of a greater or lesser degree depending on the number of identical shared properties.

Psychology focuses on [personal identity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Personal_identity) which is the uniquqe numerical identity of a person over time. This form of identity is strongly associated with self-concept, self-image (one's mental model of oneself), self-esteem, and individuality.
