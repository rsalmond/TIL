# I'm in it for the _lore_

## Operating Systems

 * [Multics](https://www.multicians.org/)

## Toobz

 * [Origin of robots.txt](https://www.antipope.org/charlie/blog-static/fiction/accelerando/accelerando-intro.html) by none other than Charlie Fucking Stross.

## Quirks

 * The [origins of DS_Store](https://www.arno.org/on-the-origins-of-ds-store)

## Semiconductors

I'd heard of William Shockley and the traitorous eight before, but until today I did not know that [the idea for the transistor was put in his head](https://www.chipstrat.com/p/the-long-arc-of-semiconductor-scaling) by Bell Labs president [Mervin Kerry](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mervin_Kelly). Also, apparently earlier in his career TSMC founder Morris Chiang was working at Sylvania and reading Shockley's book and discovered that a colleague of his who worked on semiconductor fabrication was a drunk so he would follow him to the bar at night, ply him with drinks, and press him for details on the process.

Do things that don't scale I guess?

## Culture

 * The [Jargon File](http://catb.org/jargon/html/)
 * Stumbled across [this old Atlantic piece](https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2013/10/computing-power-used-to-be-measured-in-kilo-girls/280633/) which is locked up behind a paywall but the factoid that caught my eye is in the headline. Apparently before we started using FLOPS, when complex calculation was delegated to teams of women who cranked out solutions by hand, computational capacity was quantified in unit called the "kilo-girl".

## Security

 * A [forty year old report](https://www.tuhs.org/Archive/Documentation/TechReports/Bell_Labs/ReedsShellHoles.pdf) warning about the dangers of setuid way back in the 20th century.

## Etymology

 * [Boilerplate Code](https://buttondown.com/hillelwayne/archive/why-do-we-call-it-boilerplate-code)
