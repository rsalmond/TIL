# Life

[Three domain system](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Three-domain_system) break down into [Domains](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Domain_(biology)). Viruses get a [notable mention](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Non-cellular_life) for being life-ish.

## [Archaea](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Archaea)

Classified as [prokaryotes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prokaryote), asexual single celled critters without a nucleus, mitochondria, and most other organelles. Cell membranes are branched hydrocarbon chains attached to glycerol by ether linkages, which improve their ability to withstand extreme temperatures and acidic conditions. Range from 0.1um to 15um in diameter and up to 200um long, they're about the size of bacteria or mitochondria found in eukaryotes.

## [Bacteria](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bacteria)

Another group of prokaryotes, mostly single celled, possesing circular chromosomes, have no nucleus, and rarely contain membrane bound organelles. Unlike archaea they do have ester linked lipids (phospholipid bilayers) for cell membranes rather than ether linkages.

There's something interesting here also about ribosome subunits and sedimentation rates. TODO: read more.

## [Eukarya](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eukarya)

All organisms whose cells posses a membrane bound nucleus.
