## Protein Stack

* Amino Acid - oganic compounds which contain both amino and carboxylic acid functional groups. Serve as monomers proteins.
* Oligopeptide - short (fewer than 20) polymer of amino acids, include dipeptides, tripeptides, and tetrapeptides.
* Peptides - short polymer of 20 to 30 amino acids.
* Polypeptide - longer, continuous, unbranched peptide polymer.
* Protein - polypeptide (often with a molecular mass > 10k [Da](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dalton_(unit))) folded into a stable structure.
* Protein complex - a group of two or more associated proteins.

## Genome Stack

* Nucleotide - organic compound composed of a nitrogenous base, a pentose sugar, and a phosphate. Serve as monomers for DNA/RNA.
  * If the sugar is ribose, the nucleotide polymerises into RNA, if it's deoxyribose, you get DNA.
* Oligonucleotide - short (fewer than 20) polymer of nucleotides.
* Polynucleotide - longer polymer.
* Nucleic Acid - DNA or RNA.
* Nucleosome - Complex consisting of 1.65 turns (~147 base pairs) of DNA wrapped around eight histones (histone octamer) resembling a spool of thread.
* Chromatin - Complex consisting of DNA and a histone complex which wraps long DNA polymers around histones forming dense, compact structures to prevent them from becoming tangled.
* Chromosome - Compacted package of DNA containing all or part of the genetic material for an organism.
  * Usually linear in structure and found in the nucleus of eukaryotes
  * Usually circular in structure and found in the cytoplasm of prokaryotes.
* Genome - complete package of DNA for an organism.

## Machinations

* Ribosome - synthesizes proteins by linking amino acids together in the order specified by codons of messenger RNA.
