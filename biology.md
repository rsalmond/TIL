* Amino Acid - oganic compounds which contain both amino and carboxylic acid functional groups, serve as monomers.
* Oligopeptide - shorter (fewer than 20) polymer of amino acids, include dipeptides, tripeptides, and tetrapeptides.
* Peptides - short polymer of 20 to 30 amino acids.
* Polypeptide - longer, continuous, unbranched peptide polymer.
* Protein - polypeptide (often with a molecular mass > 10k [Da](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dalton_(unit))) folded into a stable structure.
* Protein complex - a group of two or more associated proteins.
